## Peer Input Review Points
1. I want to simulate the ising model. The main entry point is `ising_model.py`. This is a very
crude implementation, but gets the job done and also calculates the various physical properties 
shown in the images.
2. Is the code clear and easy to follow? Or should I break it up more?
3. I am stil trying to figure out the exact questions I should be asking. I am considering something
along the lines of "Given a lattice size, and average energy, absolute magnetism per spin, what's the best guess of temperature?" 
Any review on this will be appreciated.
